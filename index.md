# About me

I'm a PhD student at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) in the [Mechatronics group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/systems-and-control/Pages/Mechatronics.aspx), within the division of Systems and Control of the Electrical Engineering (E2) department. My research topic consists of robotic manipulation of deformable objects using learning-based methods. My position is funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, as part of the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/). I previously also completed my Master studies at Chalmers, where I did my thesis work within the [Biomechatronics and Neurorehabilitation Lab](http://www.bnl.chalmers.se/wordpress/). My focus was on implementing Deep Learning methods for myoelectric control, which has applications in robotic prosthetics and neuromuscular rehabilitation.

I started my graduate studies in February, 2019 after working for a little over a year as an engineering consultant at [i3tex](https://www.i3tex.com/). My research project lies at the intersection of machine learning, robotics and automatic control. My aim is to specialize in robotics and AI, with a focus on learning-based approaches for control.

## Project Description

Modern robotic applications require handling of deformable objects. In industrial settings, a multitude of deformable objects are handled on a daily basis, ranging from *linear* objects such as cables and wires that have to be installed on electronic devices; to *planar* objects like sheets of metal which can be cut and molded; to *volumetric* objects made for example of foam materials which can be applied as padding for insulation purposes. Outside industrial settings, there are numerous other potential applications of deformable object manipulation, in fields ranging from agriculture to medicine. The main goal of my research project is to address such robotic manipulation problems by combining (i) data-driven modeling of robot-object interaction based on Deep Neural Networks and vision/force data, and (ii) design of control policies based on Reinforcement Learning principles.
