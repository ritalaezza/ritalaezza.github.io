# About me

I'm a Project Assistant at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) in the Automation group, within the division of [Systems and Control](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/systems-and-control/) of the Electrical Engineering (E2) department. I've also completed my MSc and PhD at Chalmers. 

During my Master's studies, I did my thesis work within the FKA [Biomechatronics and Neurorehabilitation Lab](http://www.bnl.chalmers.se/wordpress/). My focus was on implementing Deep Learning methods for myoelectric control, which has applications in robotic prosthetics and neuromuscular rehabilitation. 

For my PhD degree, my research topic consisted of robotic manipulation of deformable objects using learning-based methods, with a focus on Reinforcement Learning. I started my graduate studies in February, 2019 in the Mechatronics group and defended my thesis in April, 2024. My position was funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, as part of the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/).

Now that I have defended my PhD, I will continue in academia to pursue my original goal: *Healthcare Robotics*. With my background in Biomedical Engineering and Robotics, I want to continue developing my knowledge and skills to maximize my contribution to the field I am most passionate about. 

## Current Project Description

I am currently involved in the AURORA project: Adaptive User-Centered Robotic Rehabilitation. The aim is to develop customisable rehabilitation equipment that optimizes patient recovery after injury, both through better data collection and eventually with active support of the physiotherapy exercises. 

## PhD Project Description

Modern robotic applications require handling of deformable objects. In industrial settings, a multitude of deformable objects are handled on a daily basis, ranging from *linear* objects such as cables and wires that have to be installed on electronic devices; to *planar* objects like sheets of metal which can be cut and molded; to *volumetric* objects made for example of foam materials which can be applied as padding for insulation purposes. Outside industrial settings, there are numerous other potential applications of deformable object manipulation, in fields ranging from agriculture to medicine. The main goal of my research project is to address such robotic manipulation problems by combining (i) data-driven modeling of robot-object interaction based on Deep Neural Networks and vision/force data, and (ii) design of control policies based on Reinforcement Learning principles.
